This Website Agreement ("Agreement") is a valid legal agreement between Godengo, Inc. ("Godengo") and you, the individual or business entity ordering Godengo's web services ("Services") either via an on-line order form or via Godengo's customer service call center ("Sign-up Process"). This Agreement governs your purchase and use of Godengo's Services ordered by you during the Sign-up Process.

Individuals, organizations, and businesses located in countries subject to United States embargoes as well as any person, listed on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals, or listed on U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Order or Entities List may not enter into agreements associated with the Products or Services available from Godengo. Restricted countries currently include (and are subject to change per guidance from the United States government) Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria. By placing your order with Godengo, you acknowledge that you are not such a person, organization or business.

You must complete the acceptance process below before Godengo will activate the Services. By selecting the "ACCEPT" button below, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement ("Terms of Service"). If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, you should select the "DECLINE" button below. Godengo reserves the right to reject this Agreement for any reason prior to acceptance. Activation of the Services will indicate Godengo's acceptance of this Agreement.

Godengo may amend or otherwise modify this Agreement at any time and from time to time without notice. You will be bound by the amended Agreement upon your continued use of the Services after the revised Agreement is posted at www.godengo.com. You may identify whether Godengo has revised this Agreement by referring to the Effective Date in Section 8.9 below.

1. Services 

Godengo offers various website, web marketing and advertising plans which are published on Godengo web properties. Subject to these Terms of Service and during the term of this Agreement, Godengo agrees to provide to you the Services you select during the Sign-up Process. Godengo reserves the right to amend its Services offerings and to add, delete, suspend or modify the terms and conditions of the Services, at any time, and to determine whether and when any such changes apply to both existing and future customers.

2. Fees and Payment Terms

2.1 Godengo may charge set up fees, recurring service fees, and other one-time fees for the services you have ordered (collectively "Service Fees"). The rate you will be billed for the Services is determined during the sign up process and will not change during the term of this agreement.

2.2 All Service Fees are due on the first day of the billing cycle. All Service Fees and other monetary payments must be made in U.S. Dollars. If you are not billed by invoice, you authorize Godengo to charge the credit card (your "Payment Process") that you provide to Godengo for payment of the Service Fees for Services you order before Godengo activates the Services. You further authorize Godengo to charge you according to your Payment Process for the amount of all subsequent periodic Service Fees (at Godengo's then-current rates) prior to the commencement of any renewal period for such Services as described in Section 3 of this Agreement and for the amount of all other fees and charges (at Godengo's then-current rates) as they become payable pursuant to this Agreement. Services Fees and all other fees and charges that become due during any renewal period will be charged according to your previous payment option and/or Payment Process. All Payment Process payments are deemed authorized by you and will be assessed in real time.

2.3 If Godengo does not receive payment from your Payment Processor (i.e., credit or debit card issuer or other financial institution), you agree to pay Godengo all amounts due upon demand. Godengo may charge you for a late payment fee equal to one percent (1.0%) on any overdue balance, or the maximum amount allowed by law if less, for as long as the overdue amount remains unpaid. Godengo may also charge you for a reasonable administrative fee for any returned checks or if your Payment Processor declines payment. You agree to pay Godengo's collection costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, if Godengo is required to take action to collect any amounts that you fail to pay when due pursuant to this Agreement.

2.4 Godengo may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, immediately suspend or terminate your Services without notice to you if you fail to provide valid Payment Processor information or authorization or fail to pay for any Services when due. Godengo may charge a Ten Dollar ($10.00) fee to reinstate any Service that has been suspended or terminated.

3. Term and Termination

3.1 The Agreement will continue for the term stated during the Sign-up Process or, if no term is stated, on a month-to-month basis. The Agreement will automatically renew for successive terms, each equal in length to that of the initial term. Each renewal will be governed by the Agreement in effect (posted on our website) at the time of the renewal. Either party may terminate this Agreement effective at the end of the then current term, whether annual, month-to-month or some other fixed term, upon at least thirty (30) days notice prior to the end of the then current term and such termination will be effective upon expiration on the last day of the then current term. The termination of this Agreement will constitute the termination of all of your Services.

3.2 If you breach any term of this Agreement Godengo may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, suspend or terminate your Services immediately and without notice to you.

3.3 IF THIS AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE INITIAL TERM, GODENGO WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY REFUND OR CREDIT TO YOU FOR ANY SERVICE FEES THAT YOU PAID IN ADVANCE, BY CREDIT CARD OR OTHERWISE
